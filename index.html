                                  <p> The COVID-19 pandemic constituted the most severe global labour market and livelihoods shock since the Second World War. Beyond its immediate public health consequences, the crisis disrupted employment systems, exposed structural vulnerabilities in labour markets, intensified informality, weakened institutional capacity, and exacerbated inequalities across and within countries. While macroeconomic recovery is underway in many regions, the livelihoods impacts of the pandemic remain uneven, incomplete, and highly stratified. This publication examines the policy priorities required to secure sustainable livelihoods in a post-COVID-19 world, with particular attention to employment systems, fragile and migrant-hosting contexts, and institutional governance. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> Globally, the pandemic resulted in unprecedented employment losses, reduced working hours, and income insecurity, disproportionately affecting women, youth, informal workers, migrants, and workers in low-wage service sectors. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that global working-hour losses in 2020 were equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs, with recovery trajectories diverging sharply between advanced economies and low- and middle-income countries. These shocks revealed not only cyclical vulnerabilities but also deep structural deficiencies in labour market institutions, social protection systems, and economic diversification strategies. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> The central finding of this analysis is that post-COVID recovery strategies that prioritize aggregate growth without addressing employment quality, institutional capacity, and livelihood resilience risk entrenching pre-existing vulnerabilities. Sustainable livelihoods require a policy shift from short-term employment restoration toward integrated frameworks that combine decent work creation, inclusive economic transformation, adaptive social protection, and institutional reform. Evidence from diverse contexts—including OECD economies, emerging markets, fragile states, and migrant-hosting countries—demonstrates that countries with stronger labour market institutions, pre-existing social protection infrastructure, and coordinated policy systems were better able to absorb shocks and accelerate recovery. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> This study further finds that migration and host-community economies require targeted policy attention. Migrant workers and displaced populations experienced disproportionate income losses and exclusion from relief measures, while host communities faced intensified labour market competition and service delivery pressures. Policy responses that integrate migrants into national employment and social protection systems—rather than treating them as exceptional cases—have shown greater economic and social returns. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> At the institutional level, the pandemic underscored the importance of policy coherence across employment, social protection, fiscal policy, and local governance. Fragmented governance arrangements limited the effectiveness of emergency responses in many countries, while coordinated institutional mechanisms enhanced implementation capacity and accountability. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> The policy implications are clear. Governments and multilateral institutions must recalibrate recovery strategies toward employment-centred growth, strengthen labour market governance, expand adaptive social protection, and invest in institutional resilience. Financing strategies must align short-term stimulus with medium- and long-term structural transformation, leveraging domestic resource mobilization, concessional finance, and multilateral coordination. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> This publication advances a set of strategic recommendations across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. In the short term, priorities include employment-intensive recovery measures, targeted support for vulnerable workers, and institutional coordination mechanisms. Medium-term strategies emphasize labour market formalization, skills systems reform, and inclusive local economic development. Long-term reforms focus on structural transformation, resilient institutions, and alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 1 (No Poverty), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Collectively, these measures provide a globally relevant framework for advancing sustainable livelihoods in an increasingly uncertain world.	</p>

                                     <p> The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a synchronized global economic and employment shock unparalleled in recent history. Unlike previous crises, the pandemic simultaneously constrained labour supply, suppressed demand, disrupted global value chains, and restricted mobility. Employment systems—particularly those characterized by high informality, weak social protection, and limited fiscal space—were acutely affected. While vaccination campaigns and macroeconomic stabilization measures facilitated partial recovery, the livelihoods impacts remain persistent, especially in low-income, fragile, and migrant-hosting contexts. </p>
                                     
                                     <h4 class = "page_subheading"> 2.2 Literature and Policy Gap </h4>
                                     
                                     <p> Existing literature on COVID-19 recovery has largely focused on macroeconomic stabilization, fiscal stimulus, and sectoral recovery. Less attention has been given to the structural conditions underpinning sustainable livelihoods, particularly the interaction between labour market institutions, migration dynamics, and governance systems. Moreover, policy discussions often treat employment recovery and social protection as parallel tracks rather than integrated components of a livelihoods system. </p>
                                     
                                     <h4 class = "page_subheading"> 2.3 Research Relevance </h4>
                                     
                                     <p> This publication addresses this gap by adopting a livelihoods-centred, institutionally grounded perspective. It situates employment recovery within broader economic, social, and governance frameworks, offering policy-relevant insights for governments and multilateral institutions. </p>
                                     
                                     <h4 class = "page_subheading"> 2.4 Link to Global Frameworks </h4>
                                     
                                     <p> The analysis aligns with key global frameworks, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the ILO Decent Work Agenda, and international commitments on inclusive growth, migration governance, and institutional effectiveness. It emphasizes policy coherence and systemic resilience as prerequisites for sustainable development. </p>		


                                     <p> The pandemic exposed a fundamental disconnect between macroeconomic performance and livelihood security. In several economies, output recovered faster than employment, and employment faster than income security, revealing structural weaknesses in labour transmission mechanisms. This divergence challenges conventional recovery models that assume growth-led employment generation. </p>
                                     
                                     <p> Existing policy responses have prioritized short-term stabilization but have insufficiently addressed structural labour market dualism, the erosion of contributory social insurance bases, and the exclusion of migrants and informal workers from national systems. Moreover, crisis-response literature often treats governance capacity as exogenous, rather than as a policy variable shaped by institutional design. </p>

                                  <p> Evidence indicates that employment recovery has been uneven across sectors and worker groups. Informal workers experienced prolonged income losses, while high-skill sectors recovered more rapidly. Countries with employment retention schemes and wage subsidies demonstrated faster stabilization. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> Employment losses were most severe in contact-intensive services, informal urban employment, and export-oriented sectors reliant on global mobility. While employment levels recovered in many economies, working-hour deficits and earnings gaps persisted, particularly among low-wage workers. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> Comparative evidence shows that employment retention schemes were more effective than post-hoc job creation programs in preserving livelihoods. However, their effectiveness depended on administrative capacity and formal employment coverage, limiting their reach in developing economies. </p>

                                  <p> High informality constrained the reach of emergency support measures. In many low-income countries, over 60 per cent of workers lacked access to social insurance, limiting recovery prospects. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> Informality emerged as the single most significant predictor of livelihood insecurity. Informal workers were disproportionately excluded from wage subsidies, unemployment insurance, and contributory pensions. Even where emergency transfers were introduced, delivery gaps and targeting errors limited impact. </p>
                                  
                                  <p> Evidence from middle-income countries with partial formalization reforms indicates that hybrid social protection mechanisms—combining contributory and tax-financed elements—improved coverage and reduced exclusion. </p>

                                 <p> The post-COVID period represents a structural inflection point for labour markets and livelihoods. Recovery strategies that fail to address institutional and employment quality dimensions risk reproducing vulnerability under future shocks. Sustainable livelihoods must therefore be positioned at the core of economic governance, institutional reform, and global development cooperation. </p>
                                 <p> This publication demonstrates that sustainable livelihoods in a post-COVID-19 world depend on integrated employment, social protection, and governance reforms. The pandemic revealed structural weaknesses but also provided a policy window for transformative change. Aligning recovery strategies with long-term development objectives is essential for resilient, inclusive growth. </p>
